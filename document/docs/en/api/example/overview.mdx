# Overview

The pages in this section mirror the **demo app** (`examples/demo`) and are rendered from the **`demo`** workspace package. Use the sidebar to open each example; each page shows the same component as in the demo app.

## Use as a package

```ts
// package.json
"dependencies": { "demo": "workspace:*" }

// In your component or MDX
import { Home, Selection, generateEmployees, useContainerSize } from "demo";
```

All demo pages and shared utils are exported from `demo`.
