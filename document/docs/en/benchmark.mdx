# Benchmark

import { Benchmark } from "demo";

We provide a **side-by-side benchmark** with the same data and column schema so you can compare performance.

## What we compare

|           | react-wasm-table                            | @tanstack/react-table         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Rendering | Canvas (WASM)                               | DOM + @tanstack/react-virtual |
| Rows      | Full dataset in memory, virtualized by core | Virtualized rows in DOM       |
| Same data | ✓ `generateEmployees(N)`                    | ✓ Same                        |

## Metrics

- **Initial render (ms)** — Time from data set to first paint (lower is better).
- **Scroll FPS** — While scrolling, the demo page shows a global FPS counter; compare smoothness between the two grids.

## Run the benchmark

Choose a row count (500–10K) and click **벤치마크 실행** to load the same data into both tables and see the measured initial render times.

## Why it's fast

- **Canvas** — No DOM nodes per cell; one canvas draws all visible content.
- **Rust/WASM** — Layout (Taffy), hit-testing, and scroll math run in WebAssembly.
- **Virtualization** — Only visible rows are laid out and drawn; the rest stay in JS memory.
